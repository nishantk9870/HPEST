          Bedbugs are small, nocturnal, wingless insects belonging to the insect family of Cimicidae. They feed on humans and other

          flattened body and their skin colour is either rust brown or a deeper red brown. Nymph bed bugs are clear or a
          yellowish colour and are generally 1-4mm long. Bed bugs have two antennae and six legs.
