            There are approximately 26 species of snakes in India. These cold-blooded reptiles are often seen basking in the sun or hiding in the shadows in order to regulate their body temperature. Even though they have no arms or legs, snakes move about quickly and are adept climbers and swimmers. Though they are generally helpful to humans because they eat insects and rodents, many people fear snakes.
