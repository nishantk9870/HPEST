        <h3>Bats</h3>
        <div>
          As the only mammals capable of flight, bats are beneficial to humans because they eat a great number of flying insect pests
          like mosquitoes. However, bats are also considered nuisances, especially when they choose to roost in attics. Some
          species, such as little brown bats and big brown bats, roost together in large colonies and create problems by
          spreading diseases and damaging homes.
