        <h3>Ants</h3>
        <div>
          Ants can be difficult to get rid of once they establish a colony. Managing and controlling infestations is necessary if ants
          are frequently seen in your home or there are signs of a nearby nest. Before controlling an ant problem, it is
          important to know what species of ant you are dealing with. Having basic knowledge on the appearance, behaviour,
          nesting habits, and type of problems ants cause can help identify the ant species in order to use proper control
          methods.
