          A typical adult fly has three body parts: head, thorax and abdomen. The colour and body size varies depending on species;
          most are small in size, typically measuring no more than 10 millimetres long. The head has a pair of compound eyes,
          a pair of antennae, and variously modified mouthparts. The thorax is the locomotor center; it bears a pair of functional
          membranous wings used in flight and three pairs of functional legs. The immature forms, called larvae, are tiny,
          cream-whitish, legless, and often worm-like.
